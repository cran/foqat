\title{Calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone}
\usage{
dm8n(
  df,
  colid = 1,
  colio = 2,
  starthour = 0,
  endhour = 16,
  nh = 6,
  nc = 14,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  outputmode = 1,
  unitlb = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe of time series for ozone and other related parameters.}

\item{colid}{column index for date-time. By default, it equals to 1.}

\item{colio}{column index for ozone. By default, it equals to 2.}

\item{starthour}{numeric, start hour for calculating 8-hour ozone. By default, it equals to 0.}

\item{endhour}{numeric, end hour for calculating 8-hour ozone. By default, it equals to 16 which means averaging ozone between 16~23.}

\item{nh}{numeric. The number of effective hourly concentrations per 8-hour period.}

\item{nc}{numeric. The number of effective 8-hour average concentrations per day.}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Should missing values (including NaN) be omitted from the calculations?}

\item{outputmode}{numeric, the format of the output, possible value: 1 or 2. See 'value' for the results of filling in 1 or 2.}

\item{unitlb}{labels for y axis of dma8 plot. By default, it equals to NA. If set this parameter, the order of species should same as that in the dataframe.}
}
\value{
a dataframe depends on the value of 'outputMode'. Value 1 will output 1 list which incudes
1 table (maximum-8-hour ozone) and 1 plot (dma8 plot). Value 2 will output 1 list which contains 4
tables (8-hour ozone, statistics of the number of effective hourly concentrations in each 8-hour average concentration, 
statistics of the number of effective 8-hour average concentrations in each day, maximum-8-hour ozone) and 1 plot (dma8 plot).
