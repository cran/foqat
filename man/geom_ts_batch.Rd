geom_ts_batch(
  df,
  xlab = NULL,
  ylab = NULL,
  cclist = NULL,
  bquote = FALSE,
  breaks = waiver(),
  date_breaks = waiver(),

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe of time series.}

\item{xlab}{text expression of x axis label. The default vaule is NULL.}

\item{ylab}{text expression of y axis label. The default vaule is NULL.}

\item{cclist}{vector, colors of lines. The default vaule is NULL.}

\item{bquote}{logical value. Set to TRUE if you want to use bquote in labs (xlab and y lab). The default vaule is FALSE.}

\item{breaks}{One of:
- `NULL` for no breaks
- `waiver()` for the breaks specified by `date_breaks`
- A `Date`/`POSIXct` vector giving positions of breaks
- A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as output}

\item{date_breaks}{A string giving the distance between breaks like "2
weeks", or "10 years". If both `breaks` and `date_breaks` are
specified, `date_breaks` wins.}

\item{labels}{One of:
- `NULL` no labels
- `waiver()` for the default labels computed by the transformation object
- A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)
- A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as output. 
  Also accepts rlang lambda function notation.}

\item{date_labels}{A string giving the formatting specification for the
labels. Codes are defined in [strftime()]. If both `labels`
and `date_labels` are specified, `date_labels` wins.}

\item{minor_breaks}{One of:
- `NULL` for no breaks
- `waiver()` for the breaks specified by `date_minor_breaks`
- A `Date`/`POSIXct` vector giving positions of minor breaks
- A function that takes the limits as input and returns minor breaks as
  output}

\item{date_minor_breaks}{A string giving the distance between minor breaks
like "2 weeks", or "10 years". If both `minor_breaks` and
`date_minor_breaks` are specified, `date_minor_breaks` wins.}

\item{expand}{For position scales, a vector of range expansion constants used
 to add some padding around the data to ensure that they are placed some 
distance away from the axes. Use the convenience function expansion() to 
generate the values for the expand argument. The defaults are to expand the 
scale by 5% on each side for continuous variables, and by 0.6 units on each 
side for discrete variables.}

\item{panelgap}{gap of panels. The default vaule is 0.5.}
