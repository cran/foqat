```

To begin, weâ€™ll load `foqat` and show one dataset in `foqat`:   
`aqi` is a dataset about time series of air quality with 1-second resolution.  

```{r setup}
library(foqat)
head(aqi)
```

## Calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone 

You can use `dm8n()` to calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone.  
`colid` is the column index of date.
`colio` is the column index of ozone.
`outputMode` have two options: value `1` will output 1 list which incudes
1 table (maximum-8-hour ozone); value `2` will output 
1 list which contains 4 tables (8-hour ozone, 
statistics of the number of effective hourly 
concentrations in each 8-hour average concentration, 
statistics of the number of effective 8-hour average
concentrations in each day, maximum-8-hour ozone).
This function will calculate the average values of other species at the same time and plot them.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dm8n_df = dm8n(aqi, colio=6, outputmode = 1)
```

If you do not want the plot or you want to save time, you can try `dm8n_np()`

```{r}
dm8n_df = dm8n_np(aqi, colio=6, outputmode = 1)
dm8n_df
```

## Calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone in batch

`dm8n_batch()` allows you to calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone of multiple sites (or cities, or sensors), which means that it will calculate daily maximum-8-hour ozone for all columns except first column (date).
